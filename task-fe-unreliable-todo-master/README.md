# ROI Hunter frontend task - The Unreliable TODO

## The task

Your task is to create a simple backend-connected TODO app.

Your app needs to support all CRUD operations on TODO items.  
There also needs to be a session control component - a component where you can manage your session, create new, delete the current one, change the current session't failure rate.  
The TODOs have to be filterable.  
Feel free to add 1 - 3 custom features

**Show us your best. Like you were coding a real life, production-ready project.**

The following technologies have to be used:
* React
* Redux
* TypeScript

You can use any other technologies, as you see fit. As a scaffolding tool, we recommend [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) ([tuned](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-typescript) for TypeScript)

Develop in a GitHub repository, commiting properly as you go. When you are finished, share the repo with us.

Beware! The backend is unreliable, so you need to prepare for your requests to not be accepted!

## The server

This repository contains a server to use with your task.
Just run `npm install` followed by `npm start` and your server will start at `localhost:9000`. You can change the port in `./src/constants.js`.

If you wish to make changes to the server, feel free to fork this repo. Just don't forget to send us that link as well in the end.

## Good luck and have fun!
If you struggle, you can contact us at anytime and we will provide more information. Also if you get stuck at one point, just try to implement the rest of the functionality.
